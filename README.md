# Django Starter with CustomUser and Docutils

* Link to project on new repo: https://github.com/brucestull/DjangoStarter
    * I'm restarting the project. Want to be able to compare the way I documents not to the way I'm trying to improve my documentation. This repo will become a mostly static version of first documentation attempt.

*  Production deployment:  
    * https://django-custom-user-starter.herokuapp.com/  
    * Site may take a short time to load since the server may be asleep.  
* Instructions to run this application [locally](notes/run_django_application_locally.md).
* A pre-built CustomUser Django starter. Has pre-built CustomUser (user management app).
* See [setup.md](notes/setup.md) for my notes on creating a Django project with a `CustomUser` and include `admindocs`. This repository has some other added features in current version which are not included in those setup.md notes.
* See [deploy_to_heroku.md](notes/deploy_to_heroku.md) for notes on deploying to Heroku.
* How to [install pipenv](notes/install_pipenv.md).

## Features:
* User creation, login, and logout functionality.
* Django admin documentation generator.
* Separate settings config files for development and production.
* Settings config set up for deployment to Heroku.
